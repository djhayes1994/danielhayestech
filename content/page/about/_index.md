# About Me
I am a hardworking information technology professional with a love for system administration and engineering.

I have worked in the MSP space for 7 years, with a majority of that time spent managing centralized tools (RMM, Backups, Anti-virus, Anti-Spam, and more).

This experience has enabled me to manage a sizeable amount of endpoints across several different business verticals and environments. While also making use of automation via various tools (RMM, Powershell, Intune/Endpoint Manager).
