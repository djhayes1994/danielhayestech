With the introduction of the security baselines from Microsoft it is necessary for you to use Modern Authentication in your PowerShell scripts/if you want to connect to Exchange Online. 

Connecting to Exchange Online is a pretty easy process and you can do so by following the steps below:

  1. Open Powershell and install the Exchange Online module. To do this you will need to run the following command:

<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code ">
  <pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
</pre>
</div>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    After the module has been installed you will want to import the module so the commands are available. To do this you will need to run the following command:
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code ">
  <pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
</pre>
</div>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Once the module has been imported you will need to connect to Exchange Online.
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code ">
  <pre class="brush: powershell; title: ; notranslate" title="">
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName &lt;your admin upn&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    You will now be prompted for credentials. Provide the credentials and approve the MFA request via your MFA app (Duo, Authenticator, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    If it was successful you will receive a prompt like the one below:
