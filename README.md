This is a personal blog that I am doing as a small project to learn development using Hugo.

Static app is hosted via render.com

# Why did I do this?

I got tired of using WordPress and read an article about another person attempting to deploy a static web app with Hugo.

I originally set out to deploy this in Azure via a static web app, however due to cost savings I chose to use Render.com
